## [](#header-3) How I got started with AI

I am a member of the [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Group](http://www.secyt.frba.utn.edu.ar/giar/) in UTN - Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I'm working on a [BCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) project.

I am interested in Machine Learning algorithms, and I found several types of implementations across the web, that I tried and coded. I am by no means an expert, just an enthusiast. 

#### [](#header-3)[K-NN Algorithm](k-nn-v1).

The K- Nearest Neighbour is one of the simple yet powerful algorithms, and I first encounter it when I was reading about swarm intelligent, and later, about Ant Colony Simulation. 

One of the uses of this type of simulations is related to the Travelling Salesman Problem, and I found a nice example using a NBA dataset. Click on the title for a more complete description. 

#### [](#header-3) [Linear Regression with One Variable](linear-regression-one)

Another simple algorithm, this time for the use of prediction. Actually, this example is taken from the Coursera course Machine Learning, a great place to start by the way. In this case, I translate the code from Matlab to Python. Click on the title for a more complete description.

#### [](#header-3) [Recommender Systems](recommender-systemms)

In [ECI's](http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci) courses of 2016, I was lucky enough to get a spot on the lecture of [Carlos Castillo](http://chato.cl/): Data Mining in Graphs and Social Media. It was a great introduction and [**here**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9XnQ28QMi7HZHgySHdzdHl6V3c) you can check out my graded work about Facebook.

This motivated my curiosity about Recommender Systems and how it works, so I begin searching about movie ratings. This is how a found out about the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) page and furthermore, about the GroupLens research lab.

Here are a few links you could try if you already have some foundation:

* [Linear Regression](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/879043/Implementing-Gradient-Descent-to-Solve-a-Linear-Re).


* [K-NN and the NBA](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/k-nearest-neighbors-in-python/)

And an even better:
