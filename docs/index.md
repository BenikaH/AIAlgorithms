##### [](#header-3) How I got started with AI

I am a member of the [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Group](http://www.secyt.frba.utn.edu.ar/giar/) in UTN - Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I'm working on a [BCI](Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Group) project.

I am interested in Machine Learning algorithms, and I found several types of implementations across the web, that I tried and coded.

Here are a few links you could try if you already have some foundation:

* [Simple Neural Network in Python](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1#.w8syxd4fc).


* [Linear Regression](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/879043/Implementing-Gradient-Descent-to-Solve-a-Linear-Re).


* [K-NN and the NBA](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/k-nearest-neighbors-in-python/)

And an even better place to start:

* [Coursera: Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home)


#### [](#header-3)[K-NN Algorithm](k-nn-v1).

The K- Nearest Neighbour is one of the simple yet powerful algorithms, and I first encounter it when I was reading about swarm intelligent, and later, about Ant Colony Simulation. 

One of the uses of this type of simulations is related to the Travelling Salesman Problem, and I found a nice example using a NBA dataset. Click on the title for a more complete description. 

#### [](#header-3) [Linear Regression with One Variable](linear-regression-one)

Another simple algorithm, this time for the use of prediction. Actually, this example is taken from the Coursera course Machine Learning, a great place to start by the way. In this case, I translate the code from Matlab to Python. Click on the title for a more complete description.

In [ECI's](http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci) courses of 2016, I was lucky enough to get a spot on the lecture of [Carlos Castillo](http://chato.cl/) and Data Mining in Graphs and Social Media, great course.
