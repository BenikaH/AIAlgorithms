#### [](#header-5) How I got started with AI

I am a member of the [Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Group](http://www.secyt.frba.utn.edu.ar/giar/) in UTN - Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I'm working on a [BCI](Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Group) project.

#### [](#header-3)[K-NN Algorithm](k-nn-v1).

The K- Nearest Neighbour is one of the simple yet powerful algorithms, and I first encounter it when I was reading about swarm intelligent, and later, about Ant Colony Simulation. 

One of the uses of this type of simulations is related to the Travelling Salesman Problem, and I found a nice example using a NBA dataset. Click on the title for a more complete description. 

# [](#header-3) [Linear Regression with One Variable](linear-regression-one)

Another simple algorithm, this time for the use of prediction. Actually, this example is taken from the Coursera course Machine Learning, a great place to start by the way. In this case, I translate the code from Matlab to Python. Click on the title for a more complete description.

## [](#header-3) [Recommender Systems](recommender-systemms)

In [ECI's](http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci) courses of 2016, I was lucky enough to get a spot on the lecture of [Carlos Castillo](http://chato.cl/) and Data Mining in Graphs and Social Media, great course.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
